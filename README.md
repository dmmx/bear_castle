# Bear Castle
A little adventure game with bears.

Requires Python 3

To run type:
`python bear_castle.py`

Exercise 36 in the book _Learn Python The Hard Way_ has you create a small adventure game based on what you learned in the previous exercises. This is my solution to that exercise.

It is also meant as a funny homage to a game of Melee some friends and I played. The game ended when we died during a tragic battle with bears.
